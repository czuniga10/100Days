Remote Repositories

git remote - manage the remote repo
git push - send changes to the remote repo
git pull - retrieves updates from the remote repo

git remote add origin <link to remote repo> - use this command when you create a repo on your local and want to add it to github
git push origin master - pushing the local(origin) commits to the remote repo's master branch
git pull origin master - pulling the changes from the remote repo into your local(origin) machine and merges them together
git fetch origin master - pulls the changes from the remote repo, BUT doesnt automatically merge them.
    -you would use this when your have changes in your remote repo and your current repo that won't merge nicely. You would fetch the data just to at least get it on your machine, then make the necessary changes to merge them on your own. Then you would run $git merge origin/master to merge

Forking a Repository
    - identically split/copy another developers repo into your own remote repo where you would be the owner
Reviewing other dev's changes
Knowing what changes to make
    -repo's will usually have a CONTRIBUTORS or MAINTAINERS file where they explain ways you can contribute

    -git shortlog -s -n - sorts authors by who has commit the most to the repo
    -git log -author="<author name>" - shows all commits made by the author
    -git log --grep <keyword> - searches all commits and shows the ones containing the keyword provided
