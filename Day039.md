PING to HTTP

ping - command to see if server is able to talk to another server with a certain address
    - ping -c3 8.8.8.8 - test server address at 8.8.8.8 3 times and print results
```
printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org 80
```
- printf runs formatted strings
- nc - net cat - connects to a web server
- | - pipe - takes output of the first program, and puts it into the input of the second program

- SO.. the above command prints the string "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n" and adds it as the input for the command ``` nc en.wikipedia.org 80``` which responds back with the header for the web server

Layers               Protocols               Concents
Application         HTTP, SSH               URLs, Passwords
Transport           TCP, UDP                PORT numbers, sessions
Internet            IP                      Ip addresses, routes
Hardware            wifi, ethernet, DSL     signal strength, access points

Servers are always just waiting to hear from another server. Once another server is ready to talk with it, then they can pass data back and forth.

PING

ping yahoo.com - will ping yahoo.com forever until you stop
ping -c 7 yahoo.com - will ping yahoo.com 7 times

If you run ping and see a websites ipaddress, it might be different the next time you run it due to load balancers sharing the load.

DNS - Domain Name System

DNS is used so we dont have to type in ip addresses into url search bars, and use words like google, yahoo, twitter, etc

host google.com - shows ipaddresses info for the site as well as any mail:to servers it has
host -t a google.com - shows specifically an ip address
dig google.com - shows same info as host, but gives more meta data

ip addr show eth0 | grep "inet\b" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
    - This command shows the ip address for the linux server you are on


SUBNETS

All ip address on a companys network block have the same network prefix (first of the 8bit numbers in an ip - ex 198.50.100.143 and 198.50.100.17 and so on)
ALSO, these "hosts" can communicate with each other without using a router

Localhost === 127.0.0.1 aka loopback interface

ROUTER

Routers connect 2 ip's together. acts as a gateway

ip route show default - shows what your default gateway is

NAT - work around for lack of ip addresses in the world for IPv4. Your router is basically your public ip address, so any time you ping outside your router, it will show up the same from you phone as it would to your comp or smart tv

IPv6 - solution for lack of ip addresses - provides billions of different ip's

Protocol            Concepts                Where's the code            failures
HTTP                Resources, URL's        Flask, Apache, browsers     error codes, slow responses
                    verbs, cookies
TCP                 Parts, sessions,        OS Kernel, sys libraries    broken connection, timeouts
                    stream sockets
IP                  IP addresses,           OS Kernel, routers          various
                    packets
WiFi                access points,          device drivers              network unavailability
                    WPA passwords

sudo tcpdump -n host {ipaddress or website} - shows more info about what server the packets are coming from and what server they are going to.

What TCP does                                       How TCP does it
communicate between two hosts                       IP layer (addresses + routing)
multiple applications per hos                       Port numbers
in-order delivery                                   sequence numbers
lossless delivery                                   acknowledgment + retransmissions 
keeping connections distinct                        random initial sequence numbers
