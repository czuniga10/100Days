Java

Classes in Java
    - Separates the what from the how
    - Encapsulates Data, Operations, Semantics
    - Object Oriented

A class is a template for creating an object
    - Contains Fields, Methods, and Constructors

Using classes
    - Flight sfToSLC = new Flight();
    - Creates and instance of the object using the "new" keyword
    - Returns a reference to the allocated memory

Classes are Reference Types
    - Flight flight1 = new Flight();
    - Flight flight2 = new Flight();
    - each are their own separate objects, and can have methods used to manipulate each individually

Encapsulation and Access Modifiers 
    - The internal representation of the object should be hidden
    - Does this using Access Modifiers
        -Private and Public

Naming Classes
    - First character is always a letter
    - Pascal Case (All words first letter is always capital)
