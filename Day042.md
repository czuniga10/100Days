Python DB API

writing code with DB-API

```
//library for db ||| for Postgres use psychopg instead of sqlite3

import sqlite3

//connects to the DB. creates a connection object which needs to be closed at end

conn = sqlite3.connect("cookies")    //"cookies" is the name of the db

//curson actually runs the queries

cursor = conn.cursor()

//runs query

cursor.execute(
    "select host_key from cookies limit 10"
)

//fetches the results and stores as results

results = cursor.fethcall()

print results

conn.close()
```

For an insert query, you must commit your query into the DB ex. conn.commit()

### Atomicity
    - A transaction happens as a whole or not at all (transaction is the act of getting, posting, updating, or deleting something to or from the DB)


psql (db name) - runs db in your virtual machine

\d shows the types of the columns in the table
\dt shows all tables in the db
\dt+ shows allo tables plus other info ie. how big each table is
\H switch between printing tables as plain text or html
