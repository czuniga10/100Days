Java

Initial State
    -Setting intial state 3 ways
        -Field initializers (int number = 5;)
        -Constructors (Person myPerson = new Person(int 5);)
        -Initialization blocks (code in brackets before any constructors are initialized and is ran before the constructor is used to create a new object)

Chaining constructors
    -The ability to use a constructor within another constructor

Initialization/Construction order
    1: Fields
    2: Initialization Blocks
    3: Constructors

    ie:
class Number{
    int number = 1;

    {
        number = 2;
    }

    public Number{
        number = 3;
    }
