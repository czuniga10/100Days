Github

Pull request - a request for the original repo's poster to pull the changes in your forked repo to their original repo
upstream - a way to have access to the original repo within your terminal
    -git remote add upstream <link to original repo> - allows you to fetch and push to and from the original repo, and not just your forked version of it

git rebase - squashes/combines multiple older commits together into one larger commit

git push -f origin - -f means force push; github will try to stop you from rebasing if you will be deleting commits to do so, so you must force push in order to get the changes made
