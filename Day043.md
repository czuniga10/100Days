Deeper into SQL

Normalization - the relationships among the tables match the relationships that are really there among the data
    -every row has the same number of columns
    -there is a unique key, and everything in a row says something about he key
    -facts that dont relate to the key belong in different tables
    -tables shouldnt imply relationships that dont exist

create table tablename(
    column1 type [constraints],
    column2 type [constraints],
    .
    .
    .
    [row constraints]
);

create database name[options]; - creates new db
drop database name[options]; - deletes db
drop table name[options]; - deletes a table

Subqueries
    -subqueries are queries from the results table you get after a select
